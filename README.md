# Sunless Sea Mod Pack

## Current
Contains mods as currently in my game. May be modified from the originals. YMMV, no warranty implied.

## Showcase
Mods made by others that may or may not be currently in use, but I like them! Currently included are:

1. Aestival Forever [(DL)] [2]
2. Clockwork Oracle
2. Easier Mod (Zubmariner version)[(DL)] [1]
4. Legacies
5. London Warehouse
6. Unnecessary Overhaul

Note 1: I've included all of these that are released here on Github as submodules so they should always be up to date. The others have the original download link inline.

Note: Easier and Unnecessary definitely overlap in more than a few places. They probably shouldn't be used together, as one will entirely override the other. Which? Who knows?

## Original
This folder contains mods made by me. Current list:

2. Better ships - image swapped


	When making the above changes what I really wanted to do was not necessarily modify the Dreadnought, but at least make the Steam-Yacht worth all the trouble it is to get it. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to add equipment slots. So in lieu of that because I prefer the graphic of the Steam-Yacht, I simply swapped the graphics. So using this version you can go to the Shipyard in Fallen London, and scroll down, the Dreadnought will look like the Steam-Yacht. It will have the corresponding stats to the Dreadnought above. 
	
	Yes it is extremely overpowered. Just the way I like it.
